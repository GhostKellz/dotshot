> Lightweight dotfile snapshot & sync tool for Arch-based systems (or anyone who needs Git-tracked config backups)

---

### üß† What is `dotshot`?

**dotshot** is a small, focused CLI app for syncing and snapshotting dotfiles, like:

- Neovim configs
- Zsh (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.config/zsh/`)
- WezTerm themes and settings
- Any other custom config files you want version-controlled

It helps keep your system's critical user-level config files in sync with a tracked Git repo ‚Äî ideal for power users managing dotfiles manually or through a central `~/arch` or `~/dotfiles` repo.

---

### ‚ö° Features

- üóÇÔ∏è Track and sync dotfiles to a defined repo structure
- üîç Dry-run mode for safe previews
- üß± Optional Git commit automation
- üß≠ Designed for integration into larger tools like `ghostctl`
- üõ† Configurable via TOML/YAML (via [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper))
